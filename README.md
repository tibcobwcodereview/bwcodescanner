# BWCodeScanner
bwcodescanner (https://bwcodescanner.com) helps automate the code review of TIBCO BW (BusinessWorks) 5.x or 6.x or BWCE and BE (BusinessEvents) projects. Typically a BW project has about 20-30 process instannces and each process instance has about 10-20 activities on average. This makes it about 200 - 600 activities to be reviewed per project. BW and BE Code Scanner provide code review rules for checking hard-coded values, ensuring compliance to standards and best practices, optimizing code and identifying known defect patterns. The code scanner products integrate seamlessly with Sonarqube by providing Sonarqube plugins and Jenkins for automating code review as part of the build cycly. This repository will contain complementary products around bwcodescanner for seamlessly integrating into different platforms.
